## Converting CBBE To Fusion Girl - An extensive Guide to create BodySlide Conversions
I hope you got to this page through the [Nexus mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40555). 
If you found this repo through Github and have no idea what this is... check the Nexus page or just leave :).

Anyway, here you can find the ugly source code of this Guide written in LaTeX. This whole thing is a 
node package because I use gulp to build the light and dark versions of the guide and package those.

This guide is kinda finished and I will not change whole sections but if you find typos than open an 
Issue and post the page and line in the guide or the file and the line in the file.
