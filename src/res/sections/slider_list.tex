This is a list of all sliders from the Fusion Girl body. This table serves as a little helper but you should not take everything 
for true. It often depends on the type of outfit you're dealing with which is why I have used specific terms for each slider.\\
An \textbf{Extreme slider} should always be checked, \textbf{can be ignored often} depends on the outfit, sliders marked as 
\textit{Ignored} can be ignored in 95\% of all cases, if a slider \textbf{Should be checked} than do so as it's around 60\% to 
have clipping, \textbf{Very important} sliders should always be checked and \textbf{if zapped} can be ignored if the body part is 
zapped
