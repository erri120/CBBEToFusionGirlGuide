I expect you to have completed the in-depth example \textbf{before} continuing with this guide. 
If you encounter any problems, go look at the example again or ask for help on discord. If it's something specific to this guide 
go the \href{https://discord.gg/JakcQPN}{discord} I'm most active on and if it's something conversion related try either my main

Starting at section 4 you will find tips for anything so be sure to also check those.\\
\textbf{Zero} check what slot the outfit uses (see biped slots section)
\textbf{First} (after loading the project) delete all bones \textbf{except} any custom cloth bones that you often find on a 
dress or special equipment (see Dress/Skirt section if you have one of those).\\
\textbf{Second} load the CBBE to Fusion Girl reference model\\
\textbf{Third} conform all shapes that you want to be affected by the slider (see Swimsuit/Bikini/Underwear and High Heels section if you have one of those),
set the CBBEtoFusionGirl slider to 100 and Set Base Shape\\
\textbf{Fourth} load the Fusion Girl reference body (or the ZeX-FusionGirl-HighHeels body if you do HH)\\
\textbf{Fifth} fix clipping for the zero-slider preset\\
\textbf{Sixth} conform all shapes that should be affected by the sliders (again depends on the type of outfit)\\
\textbf{Seventh} fix clipping for all sliders\\
\textbf{Eighth} create zap sliders if the outfit is in slot 33 (see Biped Slots section for more information)\\
\textbf{Ninth} copy bone weights\\
\textbf{Tenth} save the project as a new one and tick \textit{Copy reference shape into output} if the outfit is in slot 33\\
\textbf{Eleventh} preview the outfit in BodySlide, check for clipping and create a SliderGroup file\\
\textbf{Twelfth} fix any remaining clipping\\
\textbf{Thirteenth} test the outfit in game and take some screenshots while you're doing that\\
\textbf{Fourteenth} finish up, copy the files you created to your created mods deposit, zip them and upload to the Nexus\\
