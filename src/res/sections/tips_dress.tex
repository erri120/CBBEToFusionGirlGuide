It's not always about huge \textit{assets}. \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/users/11770218?tab=user+files}{kozakowy} demonstrates this
perfectly. This section covers the little tricks for converting a dress or a skirt.

If you have the original mod and the CBBE BodySlide files you need to take a closer look at the bones. These outfits commonly use 
custom cloth bones for realistic physics. After loading the project into OS you would normally go an delete all bones \textbf{but} 
you can't do that with custom cloth bones. You want to delete all bones that are part of the CBBE reference model and keep the 
custom bones.\\
When you've done all your fixing and move to the part where you need to copy the bone weights, you may have to increase the search 
radius by a bit so that the weights on the cloth bones are correctly copied over.\\
