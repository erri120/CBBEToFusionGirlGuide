\textbf{Gloves are not in a seperate mesh:}\\
If you have Bodysuit, for example \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40500}{this one}, and the gloves are in the 
same project as the complete outfit than you do everything the normal way until you need to copy the bone weights.\\
You may have noticed at the start that you deleted finger bones from the CBBE project. You will now have to import the 
new FemaleHands mesh that has the new finger bones. 
\textbf{First} Head over to \textit{File->Import->From Nif} and load \textit{data/Meshes/actors/character/Characterassets/FemaleHands.nif}.\\
\textbf{Second} You will now have to fix clipping for the gloves but only for the base shape as the hands do not have any sliders.\\
\textbf{Third} make the hands the reference model \textit{Select NewFHands->Right Click->Set Reference}.\\
\textbf{Fourth} Copy bone weights. The default settings are enough now that you have finger bones.\\
\textbf{Fifth} Delete \textit{NewFHands} and make \textit{BaseFBody} the reference model again.
