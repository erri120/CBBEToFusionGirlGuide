So, it's finally time for you to publish your conversion. You \textbf{should} only publish the conversion if you believe 
that you are done. Here is a reminder of steps you should've done:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Received permission from the author of the original mod}
    \item Fixed clipping for the zero-slider preset
    \item Fixed clipping for every slider
    \item If the outfit is in slot 33: Created a zap slider and made it hidden and zapped by default
    \item Copied the bone weights
    \item Saved the project as a new file with a reasonable name and:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the outfit is in slot 33: Copied the reference model
        \item If the outfit is not in slot 33: Not copied the reference model
    \end{itemize}
    \item Previewed the outfit in BodySlide and fixed problems
    \item Tested the outfit in game and fixed problems
    \item Took some sexy screenshots
    \item Created a SliderGroup file for the outfit
    \item Created a zip file containing \textbf{only} the BodySlide files of the project with \textbf{no} original files
    \item Created a page on the Nexus with \textbf{useful} information following a simple template (mine is with the source code)
    \item Double checked the contents of the file you uploaded to the Nexus
\end{itemize}
