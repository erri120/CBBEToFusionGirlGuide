I want to talk a bit more about SliderGroups as I've often seen conversion making no or bad use of them.
SliderGroups are xml files and assign ShapeData to a group. Lets look at an example:
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,showstringspaces=false]{res/other/Simply_Clothes-FusionGirl.xml}
As you can see, the Member \textit{SimplyClothesFusionGirl} gets assigned to the group \textit{Fusion Girl}. When you select 
\textit{SimplyClothesFusionGirl} in BodySlide you will also see that you can only select presets that are made for the group 
\textit{Fusion Girl}. It is important to create a SliderGroup file for your conversion so that the user doesn't try and 
build the outfit with a CBBE preset.\\
Another important feature is adding new groups if you have multiple outfits.
\lstinputlisting[language=XML,showstringspaces=false]{res/other/ShinoClothes-FusionGirl.xml}
In this example I had to convert 47 outfits and created a new group for them so the user can just select the group and batch 
build them all.\\ SliderGroups are good for organizing your conversions and can be easily created inside BodySlide using the 
Group Manager. Step \textbf{Eleventh\#2} in section \textbf{3.2.1} goes into detail on how to use the Group Manager but it is 
honestly very self explanatory so you shouldn't have too much problems with it.
