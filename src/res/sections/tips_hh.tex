High Heels are the name of the game due to the arrival of the \href{https://nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39850}{Fallout 4 High Heels System}.
There are \textbf{two} types of High Heels on the Nexus:\\
\textbf{First} the fake High Heels, developed before the FO4HHS existed. 
Lets take a look at the \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39265}{Latex Fantasy Outfit}:

What you don't see in the picture is the fact that the feet are part of the outfit and not the reference model. They used a custom CBBE
body for High Heels, cut the feet and changed them. These fake High Heels are called that way because they are the same height as 
the normal body.\\
You can convert these very fast and don't have to worry about the feet because it's part of the outfit and not of the body meaning 
that. after loading the Fusion Girl reference model, you can just zap the whole feet+part of the leg and never have to think about it 
again.\\

\textbf{Second} the real High Heels, developed using the FO4HHS. I'm talking about the FO4HHS the whole time but what does it do exactly?
You can create outfits with real High Heels that are higher than the normal body. The problem is that the HH will clip through the ground 
because the height of the female body is defined in the \textit{Fallout4.esm}. What the FO4HHS does is applying a command called 
\href{https://falloutcheats.com/command/modpos}{modpos} to the player or all NPCs that have HH equipped. The command changes the position 
of the target along the x,y or z axis and the Z-Axis is used for the height meaning that \textit{modpos z 1} will position you one unit 
higher. The value, how high the character with HH should be positioned, can be defined in an \textit{txt} file and is further explained 
on the mod page linked above.\\
That is enough theory lets look at an example \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39972}{Selfish Heels - High Heel Pack 1}:

Those are the \textit{FrankyPumps} and they use a custom Fusion Girl body. In the 1.45 release of the ZeX-FusionGirl body, a new 
HighHeels slider got introduced. I sadly had to change this whole section due to that.. anyway go and check if you have the 1.45 version
before continuing. Also make sure you are not a noob. Converting HH is on another level and can be very difficult so please do not try this 
as your second conversion.

To get started with real HH, load the project you want to convert (that has real HH), delete old bones, load CBBEToFusionGirl reference 
model, conform everything but the HH (use the mask tool), set slider to 100 and set base shape.\\
Load the \textit{Fusion Girl} reference model and look for the \textit{High Heel} slider. When moving the slider to 100 you will notice 
that the feet are changing. You will have to make sure that this slider is always 100 so click the pencil and press \textit{Tab} to change 
the default value to 100 and set the slider to hidden (it should be hidden by default). You could also just click the pencil and \textit{Shape-Set Base Shape}
it depends on personal preferences. Anyway, you will now have to adjust the HHs to the shape which can be very tideus as you will work 
with a very small brush and may have to use tools such as the transform tool or complex masking to get the shape right. This is the 
reason why I do not recommend doing HH as a beginner.
