High Heels are the name of the game due to the arrival of the \href{https://nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39850}{Fallout 4 High Heels System}.
There are \textbf{two} types of High Heels on the Nexus:\\
\textbf{First} the fake High Heels, developed before the FO4HHS existed. 
Lets take a look at the \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39265}{Latex Fantasy Outfit}:

\end{wrapfigure}
What you don't see in the picture is the fact that the feet are part of the outfit and not the reference model. They used a custom CBBE
body for High Heels, cut the feet and changed them. These fake High Heels are called that way because they are the same height as 
the normal body.\\
You can convert these very fast and don't have to worry about the feet because it's part of the outfit and not of the body meaning 
that. after loading the Fusion Girl reference model, you can just zap the whole feet+part of the leg and never have to think about it 
again.\\

\textbf{Second} the real High Heels, developed using the FO4HHS. I'm talking about the FO4HHS the whole time but what does it do exactly?
You can create outfits with real High Heels that are higher than the normal body. The problem is that the HH will clip through the ground 
because the height of the female body is defined in the \textit{Fallout4.esm}. What the FO4HHS does is applying a command called 
\href{https://falloutcheats.com/command/modpos}{modpos} to the player or all NPCs that have HH equipped. The command changes the position 
of the target along the x,y or z axis and the Z-Axis is used for the height meaning that \textit{modpos z 1} will position you one unit 
higher. The value, how high the character with HH should be positioned, can be defined in an \textit{txt} file and is further explained 
on the mod page linked above.\\
That is enough theory lets look at an example \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39972}{Selfish Heels - High Heel Pack 1}:

\begin{wrapfigure}[13]{l}{0.6\textwidth}

\end{wrapfigure}
Those are the \textit{FrankyPumps} and they use a custom Fusion Girl body. On the mod page of this guide is a file called 
\textit{ZeX-FusionGirl-HH} available to download. You can \textbf{either} use the reference model included in the guide \textbf{or} 
use the slider data from the \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37268?tab=files}{ZeX - Fusion Girl} mod page (under Miscellaneous).\\
Both options are good and have their drawbacks so you should decide what works best for you, I will cover both options.\\
\linebreak
To get started with real HH, load the project you want to convert (that has real HH), delete old bones, load CBBEToFusionGirl reference 
model, conform everything but the HH (use the mask tool), set slider to 100 and set base shape.\\
Now you can \textbf{either} load the reference model included in the guide by going to \textit{File->Load Reference} and selecting 
\textit{From File}. Click the \textit{Browse} button and navigate to \textit{data/tools/BodySlide/SliderSets} and select \textit{ZeX-FusionGirl-HighHeels.osp}.\\

You will notice that the feet of the body are already in a position for HH.\\

You don't have to worry about that little gap on the ankle. Next step is fixing clipping \textbf{but} you have to be very careful 
on the HH. You may be lucky and the HH cover the complete feet and than you don't have to do anything but creating a zap slider.\\
If you are not that lucky than you have to fix the clipping using the increase mesh tool and possible the move tool depending on 
the HH.
