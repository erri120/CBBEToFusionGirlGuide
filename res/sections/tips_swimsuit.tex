\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JuFE8AffBc&t=5s}{Swimsuits}, bikinis, sexy underwear, \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aXTR27guQg&t=2m12s}{tight g-strings}
this is the category for skimpy outfits. These outfits show a lot of skin which makes zapping parts of the body very hard. You think 
that less clothing will make for a quicker conversion but that is not the case.\\
Lets start with Bikinis and Swimsuits. I will use 
\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31788}{Shino Bikini Pack}/\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39914}{Conversion} and
\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/24329}{Diamond Luxury Swimsuit}/\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39754}{Conversion}
as examples. \textit{(Wikipedia links for those who don't have the \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7KEuKKuuas&t=1m1s}{discovery channel})}\\
\textbf{Bikinis} often have a kind of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thong_(clothing)}{Thong} with a very thin strip of material on the backside.
This thin strip is the biggest problem when converting. Remember that you conform all shapes at the start after loading the 
\textit{CBBEToFusionGirl} reference model? This is where the problems start:\\
When the material is this thin, it starts to morph in a way you don't want it to when setting the slider to 100.\\

The left image has the slider \textit{CBBEToFusionGirl} on 0 and the right image on 100 when conforming all shapes.\\
You don't want that. What you should do is load the project, delete old bones, load the reference model and look at how the thin strip 
of material morphs when conformed to the \textit{CBBEToFusionGirl} slider. If it morphs just fine without problems (probably won't :O) 
than proceed normally \textbf{but} if it morphs like in the pictures, destroying the original mesh structure completely, unload the project 
(\textit{Ctrl+W} or \textit{File->Unload Project}). Load the CBBE project again, delete old bones, load the reference model but this time select the bikini mesh,
mask the area below the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labia}{labia} shouldn't morph, conform all, set slider to 100 and set base shape.
After loading the Fusion Girl reference model you will probably have some minor clipping at the masked area, just clear the mask (\textit{Ctrl+A} or \textit{Tool->Clear Mask}),
and increase the mesh.\\
Your problems are not over yet. When you proceed to the bum sliders you will start to face the next wall:\\
You will have to make a decision on how you will change the mesh for a \href{https://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/687/918/eb6.jpg}{huge ass}. 
The thin strip of material will disappear using the \textit{Bum Apple}, \textit{Bum Crack} and \textit{Bum Chubby} sliders so you can 
either let it disappear or increase the mesh to make it reappear. It comes down to personal preference and how the mesh is structured 
in general. You can also just try increasing the mesh to see if it looks good and if not just undo it.\\
\textbf{Swimsuits} on the other hand have it a bit easier as you can sometimes zap parts of the body. Something like \href{https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40060/40060-1563200676-1831067690.png}{this} 
from \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40060}{ShinoClothes} has good options for zapping the body.\\
