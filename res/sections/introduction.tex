\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc&t=8s}{Hello there} and welcome to my guide on doing BodySlide Conversions for the 
\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37268}{Zex - Fusion Girl} body.\\
My name is \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/users/6672467}{\textbf{erri120}}, I've been modding my games for over 6 years now and 
released more than 25 conversions on the Nexus.\\
This guide is intended for modders or creators who have a decent amount of modding experience and want to start creating conversion 
for the Fusion Girl body. We will go through the process of setting up a suitable work environment, getting to know the tools, 
converting different types of outfits, testing these conversions and publishing them to the Nexus.\\
The project files containing the source code and all pictures can be found on the Nexus mod page. I recommend starting at section \textbf{2}
and reading to the end of subsection \textbf{3.2.1}. The In-Depth example will give you a good starting point and enough experience 
to start creating your own conversions. You will also find tips for converting different types of outfits and a complete 
sliderlist in this guide.\\
One last thing before you go and rush through this whole thing: you will need \textbf{patience} if you want to create good conversions.
It can sometimes take a lot of time but I will give you hints and my personal experience on how you can reduce that time. Some conversions I did:\\
