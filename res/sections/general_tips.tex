\begin{itemize}
    \item Always check what slot the outfit uses before converting
    \item Only create a new group for the conversion when it has at least 6-8 pieces
    \item The shape menu has \textit{Move}, \textit{Rotate} and \textit{Scale} functions if you don't like the move tool on 4
    \item You can also transform a shape using the select tool (0), activating the pivot point and showing the transform tools 
    (10th tool in the tool bar)
    \item If you don't like increasing the mesh from the outside, you can move the camera inside and decrease the mesh area from there 
    to push it outside. Very useful if you have multiple layers of clothing in one shape
    \item If you have problems with bone weighting make sure you did not delete any cloth bones at the beginning
    \item Collars around the neck are often higher and require a bigger search radius for bone weighting but I recommend lowering the 
    collar by masking everything around it, increasing the size of the decrease mesh tool (3) and decreasing the mesh of the collar
    \item If the original BodySlide files had any Zapsliders than you need to recreate those too

    We have a \href{https://discord.gg/JakcQPN}{discord} with nice people that can help you or you can try the offical 
    \href{https://discord.gg/PNqYQpG}{ZeX Discord} and ask there.
    \item If the original CBBE BodySlide files had finger bones, than you will have difficulties copying the bone weights as you 
    need to import the hands model (look at the gloves section).
    \item You should create a template for mod descriptions to make life easier and your mods consistant looking (mine can be found on the mod page)
    \item When you fix a problem in your already uploaded mod, create an update with the fix so people don't have to download the whole thing again

    \item There is no one true way of doing conversions, if you find a way that works for you and produces good conversion, use it
    \item Converting from Skyrim CBBE (non HDT) to Fallout 4 FG is more complex and you have to do an extra step: TESV CBBE->FO4 CBBE->FO4 FG 
    because there is currently no Skyrim CBBE to Fallout 4 Fusion Girl conversion reference. \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21111}{Here} 
    is a guide that might help you.
