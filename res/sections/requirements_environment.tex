A clean and organized environment is important for any kind of work. MO2, which we're all hopefully using, helps us in that 
regard with the virtual files system and excellent profile management.

Start by creating a new profile in MO2 that you will use for conversion only. You also want to create a new empty mod that will 
serve as the output mod for BodySlide.\\
Use the \textit{Create Files in Mod instead of Overwrite} feature to set the empty mod as the output for BodySlide tho you may have 
to add BodySlide to the executable list again if you had it from another profile.\\
You should also create a folder on your local hard drive or on your cloud service of choice where you store all 
versions of all conversions you did.\\

Trust me, keeping old conversions can sometimes save you a lot of time. My structure is very simple but effective:
