The type of Bodysuit I'm talking about is the skin tight one. Like 
\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40294}{GRIM Zero Suit Samus}/\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40451}{Conversion},
\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39558}{Cybersuit}/\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39626}{Conversion},
\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29197}{ALSL Vault Suit}/\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40145}{Conversion},
\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40076}{Vtaw Jumpsuit}/\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40081}{Conversion} or
the Bodysuits from \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10692}{Fortaleza Armor}/\href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40340}{Conversion}.\\
I of course converted all of them and noticed a similar pattern which led to the creation of this category. You can watch me convert 
the GRIM Zero Suit Samus \href{https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1d1wpIcoKJtXW9bLDDj4uzsJYj38uRZ3H}{here} but do note 
that the video is 32 minutes long and has no commentary or explanation on what is going on, I also can't put this on YouTube due to 
the content policy towards 3D meshes and educational videos. (get \href{https://www.videolan.org/vlc/}{VLC} if you can't play the 
video using the Windows Media player or Windows 10's new Films \& Tv)\\
Anyway, Bodysuits are skin tight and when done correct will even show the outline of abs or muscles on the body. This means that you 
have to work precise and create a very good zero-slider foundation. When loading the Bodysuit and loading the reference model you will 
most likely see a lot of clipping everywhere (check the video).\\
I advise to increase the mesh around the breasts and the hips a bit more 
than usually so that it won't clip. Do this now for the base shape so you don't have to do this for every breasts or hip/waist slider.\\
Bodysuits are almost always in slot 33 which means that you should create zap sliders. You can cheese this part a bit:\\ When I was converting 
the Fortaleza Armor set, I had to do a very special full body suit called \textit{BodySynth}. \href{http://www.fembotwiki.com/images/thumb/8/89/Fallout_4_Fortaleza_Armor_Synth_Suit_1.jpg/800px-Fallout_4_Fortaleza_Armor_Synth_Suit_1.jpg}{Here (NSFW)}
is a picture of that suit. Because it covers the whole body, I just did everything the normal way until I had to fix clipping. Instead 
of fixing everything for all sliders I just created a zap slider for the whole body (no mask). This meant that it took two minutes to 
convert the outfit and you had zero clipping. You should check the BodySlide files for yourself, the outfit is in the main file \href{https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40340}{here}.\\
This was a very special case but what you can learn from it, is the fact that you can often cheese the hell out of bodysuits which 
makes them a very good target for quick conversions and learning opportunities.\\
If your bodysuit does not cover the whole body like \href{https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40340/40340-1564484634-253886831.jpeg}{this one (SFW)} 
or \href{https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/40340/40340-1564484647-1331610882.jpeg}{this (SFW)} than you can still 
zap a lot of the upper body but have to be \textbf{very careful} in the bum area.\\
The mask around the bum for the zap slider has to be extreme precise and you may have to redo it multiple times to get it right. It is 
better to mask a bit more the first time to see where the limit is and than close in on the perfect mask. You don't have to go in-game
every time but can just use NifSkope or the preview function in BodySlide to check if you zapped more than you should.\\
